Our apologies, myself and Rebecca did not coordinate as much as we should have and we ended up doing the same work but with different sound files leading to two different versions based on what garbled sound file you desire. bees.js was Rebecca, and bees2.js was Benedict's. To switch between the two you can uncomment the audio tags that are currently commented out, and comment out those that are uncommented out, and then switch which file is referenced in the script tag. Sorry for the inconvenience but in the interest of showing all work we deciding to leave both.
