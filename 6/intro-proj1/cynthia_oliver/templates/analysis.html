The year of 2013 is a tragic one for NBA fans. In fact, this past decade has been full of injuries. However, this should not dampen any of your spirits, or at least not dampen them too much. This season is still full of good surprising matchups and no one can tell what is going to happen. That is the beauty of the NBA. As its motto declares, "Where Amazing Things Happen". <br><br>

The Eastern conference regular season was mostly one-sided. The amount of wins separating the number one seed, the Miami Heat, and the number two seed, the New York Knicks, is 12. With Lebron averaging almost 27 points a game with a 56% field goal percentage, one can clearly see why. Although he hasn't scored as much as he had in previous seasons, his field goal percentage is the best of his career. The same goes for Dwayne Wade. Although his 21.2 points per game doesn't compare to his previous seasons, his field goal percentage has increased from 49.7% to 52.1%. This shows how the Miami Heat is not just an athletic, young team, but also shows how they have matured since. They have been taking better shots and the stars have been distributing the ball more to make open shots. Both of these players have increased in their Assists per game since last year. With Chris Bosh in the center, and multiple capable 3-point shooters including Mike Miller, Ray Allen, Shane Battier, and Mario Chalmers, the Heat have a team with a strong potential to defeat anybody and go for a two-peat. They have shown that they were able to sweep the young Bucks team. They should be facing either the Nets or the Bulls next round. <br><br>

The Knicks, although without Amar'e Stoudemire are still strong. Melo is shooting a whooping 44.9%. That combined with the amount of times he makes it to the freethrow line makes Melo a key player. Not only that, but with Mike Woodson's method of implimenting two point guards, the Knicks have a superior advantage with the plays they can make. Raymond Felton with his athleticism not only can make plays, but he can also score when needed. The Knicks as a team is a team that's big on threes, this is where most of their points are scored and this is what puts them ahead of the other teams. If the Knicks play consistently, without any further injuries, it is safe to say that they will be playing the Heat.<br><br>

The Boston Celtics are a veteran team with players that can step up in times of need. However, with Rajon Rondo out, Celtics have to create open shots without a true point guard. It will be a matter of time before the Celtics get defeated by the Knicks.<br><br>

The Indiana Pacers have a better bench than the Atlanta Hawks scoring wise as well as consistency. Paul George and George Hill have great chemistry while Josh Smith is the only man standing now that Joe Johsnon left the Hawks. The Pacers also have the size advantage, minus the center. Pacers will beat the Hawks.<br><br>

The Nets and the Bulls are both great teams, but the Bulls have more experience in the playoffs, therefore, I see the Bulls winning this series in the next game, or if not, the game after that. Boozer and Noah in the center is a stronger force than Lopez alone, and Deron Williams has very little dependent guards to pass to.
<br>
<br>
With the Thunder and Rockets matchup, we can see that the Thunder have a significant advantage over the Rockets in almost every statistic. While it may seem that the Thunder is going to be negatively impacted by the Russel Westbrook injury, it is the opposite. We can see that almost all of Kevin Durant's stats are higher than Russel Westbrook's and since Kevin Durant will receive the ball more, it gives the Thunder a scoring advantage. James Harden has also been playing amazing basketball, but the Thunder have a stronger, more consistent team and with the Jeremy Lin injury, the Rockets should be swept.
<br><br>
The Clippers and Grizzlies matchup is a close one, because both teams are very similar in their statistics. Both teams are lucky not to have any injuries. This matchup is extremely close with the only noticible difference in their amounts of assists per game. The Clippers have a slight advantage due to this. While these two teams are evenly matched, I would have to give the advantage to the Clippers. While they are a fairly new team, they play consistently and have a good team chemistry. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin have proven to be game changers. 
<br><br>
The Nuggets and Warriors matchup is an interesting one. Stephen Curry is playing at an exceptional level, being one of the best ball handlers and shooters in the league. While David Lee is out, the Warriors have shot the 3-ball better, scored slighty more points and have more assists. The injury of Danilo Gallinari has significantly impacted the Nuggets. They have lost a man who can shoot exceptionally and score. Due to this key factor, the Warriors will move onto the mext round.
<br><br>

During the next round, I believe that the Heat will be playing the Bulls. This matchup has occurred multiple times in the past. The Heat are very much capable of dominating the entire East if they stay healthy. With the Bulls missing Derrick Rose, I see the Heat winning in 5.
<br>
<br>
The Knicks will be playing the Pacers. In the past games, Raymond Felton has shown that he can step up when Melo is not feeling so hot. If Felton continues this streak, then the Knicks have a chance against the Pacers. Tyson on Hibbert is an equal matchup, but the Knicks have a better bench, including Shumpert, Novak, and Martin. With this team with a mix of young and old, the Knicks are in good shape. The Knicks might be able to pull off a win if they stay consistent.
<br>
<br>
The Thunder versus Clippers matchup should be interesting. The Thunder trumps the Clippers in blocks, points, and 3-point percentage, not to forget that the Thunder is the best frThe Thunder versus Clippers matchup should be interesting. The Thunder trumps the Clippers in blocks, points, and 3-point percentage, not to forget that the Thunder is the best freethrow shooting team in the NBA. With Kevin Durant stepping up due to Westbrook's injury, the Thunder is stronger than ever. The games will be close, but the Thunder will leave triumphant.
<br><br>
The Spurs and Warriors matchup is an interesting one. The Spurs have amazing team chemistry, but they are an old team. The Spurs have beaten the Warriors in blocks, steals, points, and field goal percentage. The only thing the Warriors have over the Spurs is when Stephen Curry shoots 3's. He is shooting 45.3% 3 point field goals and attempts 7.7 per game that is ridiculously high and can be a game changer. His 3-point percentage is higher than his noraml field goal percentage. The Spurs should win this matchup due to David Lee being out.eethrow shooting team in the NBA. With Kevin Durant stepping up due to Westbrook's injury, the Thunder is stronger than ever. The games will be close, but the Thunder will leave triumphant.

For the Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat will be facing the Knicks. In the four times that these two have faced off, the Knicks have won 3 times. This shows that the Knicks can take on the Heat. However, in those 3 times, they had Amar'e. Now with that injured player, the Knicks have a less likely chance. Also, the Heat's playoff mode is initiated and already warmed up. Carrying the momentum for a two peat, it is likely that the Heat will advance to the finals
<br><br>
For the Western Conference Fianls, OKC will be facing the Spurs. This matchup will be very close. A team full of young spirited players, with some experience in the playoffs, against a team full of old players who live in the playoffs. The young team has beaten the Spurs before, and they can do it again. Even without Westbrook, Martin is a worthy substitute. The centers of OKC are more energetic than Duncan. Even though Duncan's jumper is better, the OKC will dominate the paint.
<br><br>
The NBA finals should be the Miami Heat vs the San Antonio Spurs. The Heat should beat the Spurs as Bosh has a better size advantage over Duncan. Tony Parker is getting old and can not keep up with Chalmers. Lebron will be dominating as always and Wade will provide good backup if one of the two aren't hot. All in all, the Miami Heat is the Ideal NBA basketball team.

<font size = '5' color = 'green'>The Conclusion</font>
<br>
According to the data, the Heat make a clean path to the finals, as the East is no match for them. In the West there are better matchups with teams with great defense like the Grizzlies and Nuggets, versus the energetic young teams such as the Warriors, Rockets, and Thunder. The Thunder should be able to make the Finals, even with the Westbrook injury. The bench is stable, and there are other guards that will not replace, but at least compensate for the loss. However, ultimately the Heat will most likely win and Lebron will most likely get his second ring.
