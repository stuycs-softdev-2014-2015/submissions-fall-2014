<font color="black"> <h3> Why League? </h3> </font> <font color="#DF7782" size=4> Watch the video and you'll see why. Obviously, we chose League of Legends because not only is it an awesome game, it also contains an unlimited amount of potential interesting data that may contain patterns. As a duo bot lane (as a team of two), we set out to find these patterns.</font>

<h2><font color="black">What is LoL?</font></h2>
<font color="#017890">League of Legends, the best game that has ever confronted the gaming community, is a face-off between two teams of 5 players. These 5 players are called summoners. Summoner are allowed to pick 1 of many different Champions(characters) to control during the game. Each Champion has specific strengths and weaknesses, along with their own special abilities. Picking certain champions wisely is very important to the game, as many champions have great synergy with other champions. The objective of the game is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, the base of the opponent team. However, in order to reach the Nexus, the Champions have to take down towers, countless waves of minions, and usually the opposing champions.

<h2><font color="black">Why Champion IP vs Win Rates?</font></h2><font color="#017890">
1)IP stands for Influence Points, which are obtained in League of Legends after every game, win or loss. Different Champions have different IP costs; the higher the cost, the more IP you'll have to obtain in order to unlock them. Obviously, the skill of the players factor much more than the Champion's "power". However, there has been some speculation within the community that Champions with higher IP costs may have more "power", and therefore, have a higher chance of winning. We intend to compare Win Rates of champions and their IP costs to figure out if there is any truth to this idea.<br><br>
2)Range and Armor are two important statistics for the game. Champions with low range need to get close to attack; therefore, they are more susceptible to damage. We will attempt to find out whether or not riot accounts for this by increasing melee champions' starting armor.</font>
