We faced many problems analyzing out data.  First of all we needed to isolate the data in the way we wanted. Although our choice of data is good, the conversion from a Google document to a cvs file gave rise to some errors and unnecessary punctuation, such as the comma. We were able to solve this problem by adjusting our code, but it was nonetheless awkward to use when trying to find the mode, mean, and median. This was solved by the helper function 'countcommas,' and we were able to accomplish the analysis with relatively few problems. It is important to note that there was an overwhelming amount of data, and there were no clear patterns in the scores of the teams. We did observe that the teams that scored higher, however, participated in more rounds than those with lower scores.

 <p3> The data itself is organized by the scores: from highest to lowest. We observed that teams with lower scores, even in the individual rounds, tend to participate in fewer rounds and concentrate around the bottom of the list. Those teams that participated in more rounds, with higher scores, and have more experience were on the top. Higher scores corresponded with a greater number of rounds, which we predict to be a result of the teams' greater experience. In addition, we saw that the number of lower scores greatly outnumber that of the higher scores. There was no consistent real standard; the mode (93.913), the median (152.892), and the mean (255.727) fell closer to the lower bracket. This is indicates just how many teams there are that compete on a high school level that cause the statistics to be not consistent at all. Furthermore, we analyzed the average of all the teams total to get a better more accurate assessment of their scores.  All in all, this data makes us appreciate the difficulty and dedication it takes to be on a Debate Team. <br> <br>
